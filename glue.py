If you want to automatically scan and retrieve paths from an S3 bucket and then process each of them, you can utilize the AWS SDK (boto3) to list the objects. However, as AWS Glue's PySpark environment doesn't natively support boto3, you'll need to use a combination of Glue's native functions and PySpark.

Here's an approach:

Setup the Necessary Libraries and Context:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions

sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session
Define Function to Derive Kafka Topic from S3 Path:
python
Copy code
def derive_topic_from_s3_path(s3_path):
    filename = s3_path.split('/')[-1]
    topic_name = filename.split('.')[0]
    return topic_name
Use GlueContext to Get S3 Paths:
Here, we're making use of the create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog method, which allows us to read data directly from S3 without specifying paths. The assumption is that you've set up a crawler that has cataloged your S3 data.
python
Copy code
database_name = "your_database_name"
table_name = "your_table_name"
dynamic_frame = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database=database_name, table_name=table_name)
s3_paths = [record['input_file_name'] for record in dynamic_frame.rdd.collect()]
Loop Through Each S3 Path, Read Files, and Produce Messages to Kafka:
python
Copy code
kafka_servers = 'your.kafka.bootstrap.servers'

for s3_path in s3_paths:
    # Read files from the current S3 path
    data = spark.read.text(s3_path)
    
    # Derive Kafka topic from the S3 path
    topic_name = derive_topic_from_s3_path(s3_path)

    # Produce messages to the Kafka topic
    data.selectExpr("value as value") \
        .write \
        .format("kafka") \
        .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", kafka_servers) \
        .option("topic", topic_name) \
        .option("kafka.security.protocol", "SSL") \
        .option("kafka.ssl.key.location", "/path/to/service.key") \
        .option("kafka.ssl.certificate.location", "/path/to/service.cert") \
        .option("kafka.ssl.truststore.location", "/path/to/ca.pem") \
        .save()
This approach assumes:

You've set up an AWS Glue Crawler that has cataloged your S3 data into a database and table.
Each S3 path corresponds to a different Kafka topic.
The necessary Kafka-related configurations have been set up in your Glue job's Spark environment, including adding any required JAR files.
The necessary certificate files are accessible to the Glue job.
Replace placeholder paths, database names, table names, and other values with your actual data. Adjust the script based on your specific requirements.
